# Carbon Wealth Explorer

**Carbon Wealth Explorer** is an interactive, web-based visualization tool that accompanies the paper  
*“Country social cost of carbon estimates and their application to assess the natural land sink”*.

The application allows users to explore country-level estimates of the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), carbon fluxes, and carbon flux contributions to comprehensive investment (CCI), as well as bilateral carbon-wealth flows, through interactive global maps and summary metrics.
